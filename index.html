<h1>Prusa i3 Kit 5 Years Reprapsource Edition Build Manual</h1>

<p>Thank you for your interest on the 5 Years Reprapsource Edition Box Frame i3 Model. </p>

<p>This kit is the most easy kit to build that we've made in 5 years. We still let you the fun of a bit of 
working with wood and let you assemble the hardware bits. But we've taken out the hassle of building the 
bits that normally requires soldering and ship them preassembled.</p>

<p><a href="Large/IMG_0577.JPG"><img src="Prev/IMG_0577.JPG"></a> <br />
2. Have a friend or a clamp hold them in place and drill through one into the center of the other, about 2,5cm (1 in) from the end. (Check this position before drilling to avoid a conflict Z-axis top brackets!) <br />
3. Make super-sure the panels line up when you drill.  </p>

<p><a href="Large/IMG_0578.JPG"><img src="Prev/IMG_0578.JPG"></a> <br />
4. Countersink the hole on the flat side and add a screw. Make sure the edges line up. <br />
5. Repeat on the other end, again about 2.5cm (1 in) from the edge and in the middle. <br />
6. Take a second pair of panels and repeat step 1-5.  </p>

<p><a href="Large/IMG_0579.JPG"><img src="Prev/IMG_0579.JPG"></a> <br />
7. Well done - you finished both sides of the frame  </p>

<p><a href="Large/IMG_0583.JPG"><img src="Prev/IMG_0583.JPG"></a> <br />
8. Orient the two sides so that the screws point TO THE SIDE in both panels. <br />
9. Place the corners approximately 450mm apart (inside to inside) and place a 3mm spacer in each one.  </p>

<p><a href="Large/IMG_0584.JPG"><img src="Prev/IMG_0584.JPG"></a> <br />
10. Place a 450mm panel between them. (This will be the bottom of the frame.)  </p>

<p><a href="Large/IMG_0585.JPG"><img src="Prev/IMG_0585.JPG"></a> <br />
11. Drill into the middle of the panel from the front, countersink and add a screw. Make sure the spacers don't move around when you drill. You want the bottom panel to be  flat and 3mm off the table. <br />
12. Add another screw. so that each corner is attached with two screws in the front.  </p>

<p><a href="Large/IMG_0586.JPG"><img src="Prev/IMG_0586.JPG"></a> <br />
13. Press the frame sides flush against the panel, put two more screws in on each side, this time on the side of the panel.  </p>

<p><a href="Large/IMG_0587.JPG"><img src="Prev/IMG_0587.JPG"></a> <br />
<a href="Large/IMG_0588.JPG"><img src="Prev/IMG_0588.JPG"></a> <br />
14. Put your frame piece flat on the table and align the last 450mm panel with open edge of the frame. (Opposite the panel you recently attached.) <br />
15. Keeping it aligned, drill, countersink, and add a screw on the inside corner of the panel. Be careful not to drill through both panels into your table. Repeat this on the other side of the frame. <br />
16. Add two more screws as shown.  </p>

<p><strong>TIP:</strong> You can add tape to keep the panels in position. Additionally you can use some masking tape to on your drill, if you have not a distance piece on your drill, to keep the drill deepth. Plan your drilling ahead to avoid the trouble of overlapping screws! You need to keep the position of the Z-axis top brackets in mind! </p>
