#Prusa i3 Kit 5 Years Reprapsource Edition Build Manual

Thank you for your interest on the 5 Years Reprapsource Edition Box Frame i3 Model. 

This kit is the most easy kit to build that we've made in 5 years. We still let you the fun of a bit of 
working with wood and let you assemble the hardware bits. But we've taken out the hassle of building the 
bits that normally requires soldering and ship them preassembled.

Position of all frame screws.  

[<img src="Prev/IMG_0576.JPG">](Large/IMG_0576.JPG)  
1. Take two of the 450mm panels and put them edge to edge on a flat surface, forming a corner.  

[<img src="Prev/IMG_0577.JPG">](Large/IMG_0577.JPG)  
2. Have a friend or a clamp hold them in place and drill through one into the center of the other, about 2,5cm (1 in) from the end. (Check this position before drilling to avoid a conflict Z-axis top brackets!)   
3. Make super-sure the panels line up when you drill.  

[<img src="Prev/IMG_0578.JPG">](Large/IMG_0578.JPG)  
4. Countersink the hole on the flat side and add a screw. Make sure the edges line up.  
5. Repeat on the other end, again about 2.5cm (1 in) from the edge and in the middle.  
6. Take a second pair of panels and repeat step 1-5.  

[<img src="Prev/IMG_0579.JPG">](Large/IMG_0579.JPG)  
7. Well done - you finished both sides of the frame  

[<img src="Prev/IMG_0583.JPG">](Large/IMG_0583.JPG)  
8. Orient the two sides so that the screws point TO THE SIDE in both panels.  
9. Place the corners approximately 450mm apart (inside to inside) and place a 3mm spacer in each one.  

[<img src="Prev/IMG_0584.JPG">](Large/IMG_0584.JPG)  
10. Place a 450mm panel between them. (This will be the bottom of the frame.)  

[<img src="Prev/IMG_0585.JPG">](Large/IMG_0585.JPG)  
11. Drill into the middle of the panel from the front, countersink and add a screw. Make sure the spacers don't move around when you drill. You want the bottom panel to be  flat and 3mm off the table.  
12. Add another screw. so that each corner is attached with two screws in the front.  

[<img src="Prev/IMG_0586.JPG">](Large/IMG_0586.JPG)  
13. Press the frame sides flush against the panel, put two more screws in on each side, this time on the side of the panel.  

[<img src="Prev/IMG_0587.JPG">](Large/IMG_0587.JPG) 
[<img src="Prev/IMG_0588.JPG">](Large/IMG_0588.JPG)   
14. Put your frame piece flat on the table and align the last 450mm panel with open edge of the frame. (Opposite the panel you recently attached.)  
15. Keeping it aligned, drill, countersink, and add a screw on the inside corner of the panel. Be careful not to drill through both panels into your table. Repeat this on the other side of the frame.  
16. Add two more screws as shown.  

**TIP:** You can add tape to keep the panels in position. Additionally you can use some masking tape to on your drill, if you have not a distance piece on your drill, to keep the drill deepth. Plan your drilling ahead to avoid the trouble of overlapping screws! You need to keep the position of the Z-axis top brackets in mind! 

#Frame assembly add top panel
##Tools needed:
Screwdriver (PH2)  
3 or (better) 3,2 mm drill bit and drill Countersink bit (Optional) second drill or power screwdriver (Makes working much easier, because you do not have to change the bits all the time)

[<img src="Prev/IMG_0593.JPG">](Large/IMG_0593.JPG)  
2. Put the motor on the spacers, put the printed piece on the motor and align it all with the frame.  
3. Drill into the side through the hole and attach a screw.  
4. Remove the motor and spacer, hold the piece against the frame aligned and drill the second hole.  
5. Add a screw. Do not overtighten these two screws or you will harm the part. (4 Nm would be fine - so go on and get some proper tools ;-)) The front screw will go through the panel. (If the screw top bothers you, you can use a glue gun and put some glue on it.)  

[<img src="Prev/IMG_0596.JPG">](Large/IMG_0596.JPG)  
[<img src="Prev/IMG_0597.JPG">](Large/IMG_0597.JPG)

#Software Setup
##Tools needed:
Brain  

##Parts:
USB cable  
[Printrun](https://github.com/kliment/Printrun)  
[Slic3r](http://slic3r.org)  

##To Do:
1. Follow the links and load down the software for your OS.  

#Motor check
##Tools needed:
Eye-hand coordination  

##Parts:
Installed Printrun (Installing printrun means simply unzipping the file into a folder.)  

##To Do:
1. Start printrun and turn on the power supply of the printer. (The extruder and heatbed should be in center position bevor you turn on the power supply!)  
2. Select the port name you are using from the first drop-down, select your baud rate, and hit connect.  
3. Status messages let you know that your printer is properly connected.  
4. Now you can use the manual controls (x+/-, y+/-, z+/-, extrude/reverse) to move extruder and heatbed.  
5. Move each axis +10/-10 and see i fit moves in the right direction  
	* +x = move extruder on x-axis to the right  
	* +y = move the heatbed up to you (away from the y-motor)  
	* +z = move x-axis on the z-axis up  
	* extrude = the small gear (which will grab the filament) should rotate towards you, when you look on the front side of the printer (the side with the z-axis)  
6. If a direction is inverted. Turn off the power supply and attach the motor plug the other way round on the electronics.  

#Set x- and y- endstop
##Tools needed:
Hex wrench  

##Parts:
Printrun  

##To Do:
1. Start printrun and turn on the power supply of the printer.  
2. The y-endstop should be pressed by the printbed plate when the tip of the hotend is over the front edge of the carbon build plate. Take into account the overlap of the paper clips, when you determin the edge postiion because you do not want to drive your hotend into them. Fix the endstop in the appropriate postion.  
3. The x-endstop should be pressed by the extruder carriage when the tip of the hotend is over the edge of the carbon build plate close to the x-motor. Fix the endstop in the appropriate postion.  
4. Bravo you determined the x and y home position.  

#Z-axis leveling and z-endstop
##Tools needed:
Hex wrench  
2 sheets of paper  

##Parts:
Printrun  

##To Do:
1. Put to sheets of paper over the carbon build plate.  
2. Move the extruder over the carbon build plate, so that just the papers fit between the hotend tip and the carbon build plate. Move carefully in small steps!  
3. If your z-axis makes noises or is not moving at all. The x-axis is not on the some height on both z-axis.  
4. Press „Motors off“. And adjust the height difference manually. Hold one of the z-axis threaded rods in position and level the x-axis by rotating the other rod.  
5. Move the hotend tip to all four corners of the carbon build plate. The paper should not be moved at any point by the hotend tip or even worse the hotend tip scratch into the carbon build plate. Adjust the height of the z-axis if necessary.  
6. If you find the right position, move the z-endstop so that it is pressed by the x-motor carriage. This is now you z-home postion.
